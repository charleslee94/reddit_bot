Python web crawler that:
<li> Crawls through steam user wishlist </li>
<li> Calls upon reddit API to look through r/gamedeals to see if any games on the wishlist are currently on sale </li>
<li> Writes results to a textfile, scheduled using crontab </li>

I had just finished Dark Souls 1, and had a blast. I had heard that Dark Souls 3 was coming out very soon, and I had a sneaking suspicion that Dark Souls 2 would be going on sale very soon. However, I didn't want to be scouring the internet for sales every day so I had the task automated.
